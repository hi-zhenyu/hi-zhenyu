Hi! My name is Zhenyu Huang (黄振宇). I'm a Ph.D. student from College of Computer Science, Sichuan Univerisity, China. Currently, I’m a student of Professor Xi Peng \[[website](http://pengxi.me)\]. In 2020, I interned at [Baidu NLP](http://nlp.baidu.com/) mentored by Xinyan Xiao \[[website](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lWRYa3wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)\].

My research interests span Multimodal Learning, Noisy Label Learning, and Unsupervised Learning. For now, I focus on designing robust multimodal learning models with strong empirical performance & real-world deployability.
